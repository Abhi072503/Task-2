# Task-2
Project Report: Cat vs Dog Image Classification using Deep Learning (ResNet18)
🎯 Objective
To implement a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify images of cats and dogs, as part of the internship task:

“Implement a deep learning model for Image Classification or Natural Language Processing using TensorFlow or PyTorch.”

🧠 Approach
✅ Chose Image Classification using PyTorch
✅ Used a pretrained ResNet18 model (Transfer Learning)
✅ Fine-tuned the model on a custom dataset of cat and dog images
✅ Evaluated the model on unseen test images
✅ Achieved high accuracy and reliable predictions

📦 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
PyTorch
Torchvision
Matplotlib
Pillow (PIL)

🧱 Model Details
Architecture: ResNet18 (18-layer Convolutional Neural Network)
Pretrained on: ImageNet (1.2 million images)
Final Layer: Replaced to classify 2 classes (cats, dogs)
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
Optimizer: Adam
Training Epochs: 10
Data Augmentation: Horizontal Flip, Random Rotation
